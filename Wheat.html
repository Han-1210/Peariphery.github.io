        <p>A song that makes me think of the golden wheat fields in Mo Yan (common u gotta know him, the first Chinese Nobel Literature laureate, bigggg deal)’s province. My province Shandong. Primitive, agricultural in some parts, hilly in others, full of magical melancholy realism in the vast fields and in the midst of thick forests. A nature-loving truant, I’ve dreamed about bounding o’er the mountain like a roe so many times… Yet I can’t play Miss Caulfield in the act. Shandong is no New York City where you can hide your rebellious brow under a red baseball cap and get your name on the billboards by kickstarting a rock band, it’s where everybody knew everybody and they honestly hope you’d stay in school and become a decent hardworking fellow. They also kinda hope you won’t become “somebody” and grow your roots permanently in a big city—home is always the best, Toto. </p>

<p>The people on the streets of Shandong have big, dark, silent eyes, field-working eyes that softly look at the truant student reproachfully: what are you doing, child? Why haven’t you a purpose in life… on this land people work until their spines turn into bendy bows. All arrows are shot into the bleeding soil to grow into saplings—this is the densely populated land of non-conflict, of chimney smoke over the grape vine-covered village rooftops, of poor rural education and suffering aspirations, of the most heavily-rivalled college entering exam, of taciturn parents who never understood you but will empty their pockets to get you through school, of acres and acres of golden wheat waves, as vivid as that neighbour girl’s eye…who only left a few words in your dreams before a moving van took her to a big city with lurid lights, who left behind her the fields’ long orange shadows, stretching endlessly towards home…</p>

<p>(To my beloved grandma Laolao, who used to take me to the playing field at sunset and watched over me, always smiling so quietly)</p>
