<h1>Between me and this song</h1>

      <p>During my first year in college, I lived in a 9-square-meter student hall room (we have conditions worse than a Scandinavian prison, and we pay 800 pounds per month… Such is Bloomsbury living!), and I had a horrible crush on the Hungarian guy living across the hall. The foggy, humid English winter distracted me from my studies and I just curled up in my bed during the day, sometimes listening to him playing piano tunes over and over again in his room. The rest of the time, I played this Hungarian song “Szerelem” by Madarász Gábor to myself, imagining love in summer time. </p>
      <p>Stubborn as I was, I began to learn Hungarian from a library book (which actually led me to my best Hungarian friend M, but that’s another story) and booked a ticket to Budapest on New Year’s eve. It was very scary for an 18-year-old who’s never traveled outside her own country before moving to college to fill in all the Schengen visa application form, explain to the blue-eyed consulate staff why she hasn’t got enough funds in her account while dreaming about meeting the guy of her dreams in the end-of-year Budapest streets, in the castles and cathedrals where he grow up. During this process, I wrote a little O. Henry-style story <Tic-tac, emotion> based on these feelings: I never allowed myself to imagine dating this guy, because his diplomatic, well-scheduled life was ran by a clock so different from mine. I did, however, imagine eating lunch and dinner with him, and deliberately lingered longer in the kitchen to say hi and goodbye, for that was the only common space I can expect to meet him. </p>
      <p>We met up on New Year’s eve on Széll Kálmán tér. Under the most beautiful sunset I’ve seen in my life, we roamed through the numerous illuminated sidewalks and passageways on the high ground around the castles and churches, and sat together before a Huntress statue by Praxiteles while the moon rose high on the black sky. We even had a tall beer and a lángost together in a cozy local bar. We drank so fast that I can’t remember what the conversation was about.  </p>
      <p>I bought a horsey gingerbread with blue and gold etchings on the mane, which I lost six months later while packing my London life into a suitcase, ready to move.</p>

        <p>Happy New Year. </p>

    <p><strong>爱情</strong></p>
<p>作曲 : Madarász Gábor</p>
<p>夏日呀，轻快的热浪拂过</p>
<p>酸甜的莓果融化</p>
<p>当你我的肩膀触碰</p>
<p>每分钟都将变成这夏日</p>
<p>你的吻留在床上</p>
<p>我慢慢睁开双眼</p>
<p>可能在门口就会与你相遇</p>
<p>这城市悸动着</p>
<p>我们两人吞下一份兰戈斯（匈小吃）</p>
<p>我什么都没吃进去</p>
<p>因为我被眼前</p>
<p>如金色光芒般的你吸引</p>
<p>每一分钟</p>
<p>我都缓缓沉醉</p>
<p>爱人啊，我的爱人啊</p>
<p>你属于我</p>
<p>爱人啊，我的爱人啊</p>
<p>你为我所有</p>
<p>我能在早晨品尝你，在夜晚浅酌你</p>
<p>我放任自己沉醉于你的笑容</p>
<p>如果你愿意</p>
<p>我将把一切交付给你</p>
<p>夏日呀，我们黏在一起</p>
<p>在属于我们的避风港上</p>
<p>烟雾随风飘散</p>
<p>每分钟都属于这夏日</p>
<p>我感受到，你揽过我的肩膀</p>
<p>我期待着靠在你身上</p>
<p>心被上了锁</p>
<p>城市缓缓沉静</p>
<p>坠入你双眼间的梦幻</p>
<p>我什么都吃不进去</p>
<p>因为我被眼前</p>
<p>如金色光芒般的你吸引</p>
<p>每一分钟</p>
<p>我都缓缓沉醉</p>
<p>爱人啊，我的爱人啊</p>
<p>你属于我</p>
<p>爱人啊，我的爱人啊</p>
<p>你为我所有</p>
<p>我能在早晨品尝你，在夜晚浅酌你</p>
<p>我放任自己沉醉于你的笑容</p>
<p>如果你愿意</p>
<p>我将把一切交付给你</p>
<p>爱人啊，我的爱人啊</p>
<p>你属于我</p>
<p>爱人啊，我的爱人啊</p>
<p>你为我所有</p>
<p>我能在早晨品尝你，在夜晚浅酌你</p>

    <p><strong>Love</strong></p>
<p>It’s summer, the raspberry melts in my mouth</p>
<p>I’m burning in a slight fever</p>
<p>If the shoulder is reaching the shoulder</p>
<p>And there is summer in every minute</p>
<p>Your kiss is resting in the bed</p>
<p>I slowly wake it up, perhaps</p>
<p>It reaches me at the door</p>
<p>The city wakes up slowly</p>
<p>Two are gobbling a scone</p>
<p>I haven’t eaten anything yet</p>
<p>Because I’m in love with you</p>
<p>There is a golden fog before me</p>
<p>Flitting softly and easily</p>
<p>In every minute...</p>
<p>Love, love</p>
<p>Love, love</p>
<p>It is mine</p>
<p>Love, love</p>
<p>Love, love</p>
<p>It is mine</p>
<p>I can eat it in the morning and sip it in the night</p>
<p>I can pour it into myself</p>
<p>And it washes me nicely, I know</p>
<p>I give all to it</p>
<p>If you want...</p>
<p>It’s summer, some of us were smoking</p>
<p>And the smoke was just sailing</p>
<p>Toward our harbor</p>
<p>And there is summer in every minute</p>
<p>I feel when you touch my shoulder</p>
<p>I wait for you leaning back</p>
<p>The key reaches the lock</p>
<p>And slowly the city goes to sleep</p>
<p>I see your eyes are sleepy</p>
<p>I haven’t eaten anything yet</p>
<p>Because I’m in love with you</p>
<p>There is a golden fog before me</p>
<p>Flitting softly and easily</p>
<p>In every minute...</p>
<p>Love, love</p>
<p>Love, love</p>
<p>It is mine</p>
<p>Love, love</p>
<p>Love, love</p>
<p>It is mine</p>

    <p><strong>Szerelem</strong></p>
<p>Nyár van, olvad a málna a számban,</p>
<p>Égek egy könnyű lázban,</p>

<p>És minden percben nyár van,</p>
<p>A csókod pihen az ágyban,</p>
<p>Lassan ébresztem, hátha</p>
<p>Az ajtóban utolér...</p>
<p>És lassan lüktet a város,</p>
<p>Ketten falnak egy lángost,</p>
<p>Én még semmit sem ettem,</p>

<h1>Tic-tac, emotion</h1>

<p>Every fidgeting soul settled in London, no matter predator or prey, male or female, flamboyantly attractive or confidently ugly, will eventually cipher the sombre code of industrial subsistence: one doesn’t get more or less than what was paid for, any attempt to survive romantically on a calculated budget shall lead one descend straightly into the inferno of co-habitation: an induction stove shared by eight people who never wipe it clean, a toilet by five who never flush, and a cramped single room that confines and suffocates the natural form and voice, like a external skeleton growing on crabs and beetles. </p>
<p>In a student hall under such radically socialist conditions lived Ming and Adelbert, whose rooms were awkwardly nudged together face to face on tiptoe like two introverts at a club social, with only a thin strand of oceanic blue carpeted in between. They have their own separate clockworks: Adelbert the Hungarian read politics, economics, history, diplomacy, epistemology and phenomenology. He was rarely seen without company, in class, at lunch, at the park, where the rustling dark leaves shaded his curls like a dream piecing itself together. Ming the Chinese on the other hand is silent in her heavy black eyes and little mouth, and is mostly seen queuing at the Chinatown evening food sales, and at a distance she studied Adelbert’s eyes, which were a shade of light grey, and vaguely blue at times. Every night, safely boxed in her room while another untraceable 24 hours rush to a dead end, Ming would carefully distill a scented diary verse rhyming by her neighbour's name, which she misspelled, having such pitiful knowledge on the Eastern European r and l. When the church bells struck eleven in the evening, Adelbert’s drowsy, weightless fingers will stretch and float across a stream of invisible keys, gushing a bitter breeze into the opposite space and filling Ming’s bedsheets with a thousand hollow chords to set sail amongst the clear night air. </p>
    <p>No one knew how the fatal moment struck, but one afternoon at precisely five p.m. when Ming was drifting through the streets and stealing quick glances from shop windows, a leaflet for ‘Hungarian language evening class, beginner level’ was thrusted into her hand. It was a split second of epiphanic gospel, suddenly the endless leaf-shrouded London alleyways pulsed and whispered, the tingling air nibbled at her ears and fingertips with persuasive warmth and agitation; thus Ming turned, rigidly, as the darkness fell so softly and unexpectedly as a drift of rain, to walk into evenings lessons after evenings lessons of morphology and syntax, blossoming strange words and phrases on her tongue. </p>
    <p>In return for the sessions, she pushed her silver necklace(the one that hangs from the chain like a quivering drop of tear) swiftly across the counter. She swallowed a gulp of cold air—“a gift of the Magi…for myself. Happy Christmas”. Will he ever notice? But simply imagine the realisation, the ignited sympathies, when he recognises her effort! Imagine a thousand emphatic glances that could soften the loneliest, loftiest resolution to mellow sighs! Imagine the lifted unspoken solicitude, the handshake on a golden morning, two pots sizzling with food from two ends of the continent; O what happiness! She closed her class notes, heard the final fainting note dissolve from his fingertip, and dreamt of home, where the gauzy neon washed over her sheepish eyes.</p>
<p>Every morning the modern Penelope waited for Adelbert in the kitchen to demonstrate the night’s work starting with a Helló accentuated on the first syllable.  Will he ever notice?</p>
    <p>But the epic moment never came. They never met there in the morning nor in the evening, long after she microwaved the rice and wiped the dishes twice. She didn’t dare to break the silence at other hours—the kitchen was the only dimension of existence they could have shared beside a tedious nod in the hallway. Doesn’t he ever come to the kitchen? She had seen his cooking utensils, and smell his specially fragranced washing up liquid…I can only wonder, she thought.</p>
    <p>39 weeks later their lease with the student hall were up, and they each found housing on the two banks of the Thames—the numerous riverboats and lurid bistros in between will divide the world into its multiplicity—eternally. </p>
<p>Moving vans were anchored on the streets below. Adelbert leaned on the sink, looking out, his shirt fluttering in the wind like a sail. Ming came in, knelt down to tidy a complicated drawer. She had to say something, it was now or never—</p>
<p>‘Why can’t I ever see you in the kitchen?’</p>
    <p>‘Hmm? I always cooked here, ’ he tilted his head to look at her curiously, ‘when do you usually come in? 6:30? And at night, 6:30 too? You see the thing is I eat at 9:00 and cook dinner at 21:00. Ah I see, your time is always a little bit ahead…’</p>
