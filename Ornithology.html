      <h1> What’s biocultural diversity? Andrew Gosler’s talk on the naming of birds, Linnean Society 26/01/24</h1>
    <body>
      <p> Before attending Prof. Gosler's lecture on bird names, I had no idea that biology and linguistics are so closely related. All I knew was that "taxonomy" means giving species of plants and animals Latin names, which seems (even without extensive studies in Saussure) a very arbitrary concept. However, figures speak louder than words - particularly when the figure shows that the number of estimated languages/km2 appears to have a linear relationship with the number of recorded bird species/km2 (displayed on a scatterplot where the dots represent countries). Does this mean the areas managed by locals who are protected by de-colonisation policies and speak their own language are actually better at conserving biodiveristy?
