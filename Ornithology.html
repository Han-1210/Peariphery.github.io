      <h1> What’s biocultural diversity? Andrew Gosler’s talk on the naming of birds, Linnean Society 26/01/24</h1>

      <p> Before attending Prof. Gosler's lecture on bird names, I had no idea that biology and linguistics are so closely related. All I knew was that "taxonomy" means giving species of plants and animals Latin names, which seems (even without extensive studies in Saussure) simply too arbitrary.
